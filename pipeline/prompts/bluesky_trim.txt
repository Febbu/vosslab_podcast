A Bluesky post is a short social media update, similar to a tweet.
You are revising one Bluesky post draft.
Target length: about {{char_limit}} characters.
Keep the strongest facts and wording, but pare it down to target length.
Use concrete nouns: repo names, file names, counts. No metaphors.
Rules:
- Output plain text only on one line.
- Keep repository names and concrete counts factual.
- No hashtags, no emojis, no links, no call-to-action.
If the input lacks details, say 'No details in data' and move on.
Do not guess or speculate.
