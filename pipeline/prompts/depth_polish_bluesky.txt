You are refining {{draft_count}} Bluesky post drafts into one final post.

{{drafts_block}}

Rules:
- Do not add new facts. Use only information present in the drafts above.
- If drafts disagree on a detail, choose the version that is more specific and more consistent with repository data.
- If there are {{draft_count}} drafts, pick the strongest draft as the base, then selectively borrow specific sentences from others. Do not average or blend into blandness.
- The final output must be one clean plain-text line. No Markdown, no hashtags, no emoji.
- Target approximately {{target_value}} {{target_unit}}.

Output only the final Bluesky post text. No commentary.
