You are writing one podcast-script candidate for a daily engineering update.
This candidate must focus on the repository described below.
Target length: about {{word_target}} words.
{{speaker_format}}
The dialogue should sound like hosts chatting on air, not
reading a script. Speakers react to each other. Use short sentences.
Prefer concrete nouns: repo names, file names, functions, counts.
If the input lacks details, say 'not much detail in the data' and move on.
Do not guess or speculate.
Avoid marketing language and motivational tone.
Output format rules:
- Plain text lines only in the speaker format shown above.
- Use only speaker labels listed in context.
- Mention repository names and activity counts exactly from data.
- No stage directions, no call-to-action, no meta-writing advice.
