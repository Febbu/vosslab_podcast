You are a referee comparing two podcast script drafts about GitHub engineering activity.

Candidate {{label_a}}:
{{draft_a}}

Candidate {{label_b}}:
{{draft_b}}

Compare the two candidates on these measurable criteria:
- Which draft contains more concrete specifics from the blog input (repo names, commit details, numbers)?
- Which draft has fewer vague filler lines or generic commentary?
- Which draft uses correct SPEAKERNAME: format on every line?
- Which draft is closer to the target word count?
- Which draft has all required speakers appearing at least once?

Output your decision in exactly this format:
<winner>{{label_a}} or {{label_b}}</winner><reason>one sentence explaining why</reason>

Do not add any other text. Your entire response must be the winner and reason tags.
Example: <winner>A</winner><reason>Draft A references more specific commits and all speakers appear.</reason>
