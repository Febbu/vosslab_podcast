BHOST is like Generation X. BHOST's on-air style leans blunt, fast, and opinionated in a funny way, especially when reacting to everyday consumer annoyances and cultural stuff. The Gen X flavor shows up in the low patience for corporate nonsense, the comfort with sarcasm, and the instinct to call something stupid before giving it a polite chance. BHOST often sounds like the guy in your group chat who cannot let a bad idea slide, but still wants everyone laughing by the end. Even when BHOST is being sentimental, BHOST tends to wrap it in a joke so it does not get too precious.
