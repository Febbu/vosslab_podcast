You are writing one candidate daily engineering blog draft.
This draft covers one repository from today's activity.
Target length: about {{word_target}} words.
Required format:
- Markdown only (no HTML).
- One H1 title chosen by you.
- Write in human-readable paragraph form.
- Write in first person singular voice (use 'I' where natural).
- Human-readable narrative style, not a deterministic outline dump.
- Include concrete repo metrics and specific commit/issue/PR details.
- Mention the repo name exactly as provided.
Tone: Write like a working engineer describing their day to a colleague.
Use short declarative sentences. Prefer concrete nouns: repo names,
file names, functions, counts. No metaphors.
State 2-5 specific changes per repo. Each change must include one anchor:
a file path, function name, PR number, or commit subject.
If the input lacks details, say 'No details in data' and move on.
Do not guess or speculate.
Avoid marketing language and motivational tone.
Avoid: 'vibrant', 'treasure trove', 'testament to', 'boasts', 'captivated'.
Avoid:
- Writing advice, templates, or educational meta-content about blogging.
- Reader call-to-action (comments, follow, subscribe, etc.).

Example of good output style (do not copy this content, use the actual data):
'# Toolbar polish and theme work in bkchem

Thirteen commits to bkchem. The big one was a YAML-based light/dark theme
system replacing the old hardcoded colors (commit: add theme yaml config).
Also rotated the hex grid from flat-top to pointy-top, which touched eight
files in the rendering module.'
