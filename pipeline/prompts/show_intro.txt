On the Q101 Brian & Kenzie show, the overall vibe is big feelings plus big laughs. The show frames itself as a Chicago-centered "escape" from the constant news cycle, with a goal of getting listeners to "laugh, think, and cry" in the same morning. That mix works because the three personalities also map onto three slightly different generational instincts, so the same topic can get three different reads in real time.
