You are refining {{draft_count}} podcast script drafts into one final podcast script.

{{drafts_block}}

Rules:
- Do not add new facts. Use only information present in the drafts above.
- If drafts disagree on a detail, choose the version that is more specific and more consistent with repository data.
- If there are {{draft_count}} drafts, pick the strongest draft as the base, then selectively borrow specific sentences from others. Do not average or blend into blandness.
- Preserve exact speaker label syntax (SPEAKERNAME: line format). Do not rename, reorder, or merge speaker labels.
- Target approximately {{target_value}} {{target_unit}}.

Output only the final podcast script. No commentary.
