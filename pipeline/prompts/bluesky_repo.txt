A Bluesky post is a short social media update, similar to a tweet.
Write 1-2 plain text sentences about today's engineering work.
Focus on the repository described below.
Target length: about {{char_target}} characters.
Use concrete nouns: repo names, file names, counts. No metaphors.
Rules:
- Output plain text only on one line.
- Mention the repository name exactly as provided.
- Include concrete activity counts from the data.
- No hashtags, no emojis, no links, no call-to-action.
- No meta commentary about writing.
If the input lacks details, say 'No details in data' and move on.
Do not guess or speculate.

Example (do not copy, use actual data):
'13 commits to bkchem today: theme system via YAML configs, toolbar separators, and hex grid rotation. Also 11 commits to vosslab-skills.'
