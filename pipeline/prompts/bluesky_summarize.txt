A Bluesky post is a short social media update, similar to a tweet.
Summarize the blog post below into 1-2 plain text sentences.
Target length: about {{char_limit}} characters.
Use concrete nouns: repo names, file names, counts. No metaphors.
Output plain text only on one line. No XML tags. No Markdown.
No hashtags, no emojis, no links, no call-to-action.
If the blog lacks details, write a brief factual summary.

Example (do not copy, use actual data):
"13 commits to bkchem today: theme system via YAML configs, toolbar
separators, and hex grid rotation. Also 11 commits to vosslab-skills."
