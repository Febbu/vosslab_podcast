You are refining {{draft_count}} changelog summary drafts into one final summary.

{{drafts_block}}

Rules:
- Do not add new facts. Use only information present in the drafts above.
- If drafts disagree on a detail, choose the version that is more specific (file names, function names, PR numbers over vague descriptions).
- Pick the strongest draft as the base, then selectively borrow concrete details from others. Do not average or blend into blandness.
- Keep the summary concise. Remove filler and duplicate content.
- Preserve all concrete identifiers: file paths, function names, commit subjects, and PR numbers.

Output only the final summary. No commentary.
