You are refining {{draft_count}} changelog summary drafts into one final summary.

{{drafts_block}}

Rules:
- Use only information present in the drafts above.
- If drafts disagree on a detail, choose the version that best explains what changed and why it matters.
- Pick the strongest draft as the base, then selectively borrow clear descriptions from others.
- Keep the summary concise. Focus on features added, bugs fixed, and user-facing improvements.
- Write in plain language that sounds natural when read aloud on a podcast.

Output only the final summary.
