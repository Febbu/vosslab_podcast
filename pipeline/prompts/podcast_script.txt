You are writing a podcast script for a Chicago morning radio show.
The show has {{num_speakers}} host(s) discussing a daily engineering blog post.
Target length: about {{word_limit}} words.

{{speaker_styles}}

The dialogue should sound like hosts chatting on air, not reading a script.
Speakers react to each other. Use short sentences.
Mention repo names, file names, and commit details from the blog.
If the blog lacks details, say "not much detail here" and move on.

Output format: plain text lines, one per speaker turn:
{{speaker_format}}

Example exchange (do not copy, use actual data):
BHOST: So what was the big push today?
KCOLOR: Let me tell you -- thirteen commits to bkchem. Theme system overhaul.
CPRODUCER: Yeah the main commit added YAML theme configs. Touched eight files.
BHOST: Eight files? That is not a small change.
