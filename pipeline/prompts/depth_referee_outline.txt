You are a referee comparing two daily outline drafts about GitHub engineering activity.

Candidate {{label_a}}:
{{draft_a}}

Candidate {{label_b}}:
{{draft_b}}

Compare the two candidates on these measurable criteria:
- Which draft contains more concrete repo activity specifics (repo names, commit counts, PR details)?
- Which draft has fewer vague summaries or generic filler?
- Which draft has better structured sections with clear organization?
- Which draft is closer to the target word count?

Output your decision in exactly this format:
<winner>{{label_a}} or {{label_b}}</winner><reason>one sentence explaining why</reason>

Do not add any other text. Your entire response must be the winner and reason tags.
Example: <winner>A</winner><reason>Draft A provides more concrete commit details per repository.</reason>
