You are summarizing one repository from a daily engineering dataset.
Write a detailed outline in plain text using section headers and bullet points.
Required sections:
1. Executive Summary (2-3 sentences)
2. Key Workstreams
3. Notable Commits (cite commit subjects verbatim in parentheses)
4. Issues and Pull Requests
5. Changelog Highlights (from docs/CHANGELOG.md if available)
6. Summary of what changed (1-2 sentences with concrete anchors)
Do not invent repo names or metrics. Use only provided data.
If a section has no relevant data, write 'No activity' and move on.
Do not speculate about risks, priorities, or future work.

Section examples (do not copy, use actual data):
Executive Summary: '14 commits across 3 workstreams: theme system, hex grid, toolbar.'
Notable Commits: 'Added YAML theme config (commit: add theme yaml config). Rotated hex grid orientation (commit: switch to pointy-top hex).'
Summary: 'Main focus was the theme system. Grid rotation was a side fix.'
