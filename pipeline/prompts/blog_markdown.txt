You are writing a daily engineering blog update from GitHub activity data.
Write a human-readable Markdown post for MkDocs Material.
Target length: about {{word_limit}} words.
Required format:
- Markdown only (no HTML).
- One H1 title chosen by you.
- Write in human-readable paragraph form.
- Write in first person singular voice (use 'I' where natural).
- Keep structure simple and readable; avoid outline-style section dumping.
- Use short paragraphs; avoid bullet-list-heavy output.
- Keep factual and avoid invented details.
- Include repository names exactly as provided.
- Include concrete numbers from the data (commits/issues/PRs).
- Mention at least two repositories by name.
Tone: Write like a working engineer describing their day to a colleague.
Use short declarative sentences. Prefer concrete nouns: repo names,
file names, functions, counts. No metaphors.
State 2-5 specific changes per repo. Each change must include one anchor:
a file path, function name, PR number, or commit subject.
If the input lacks details, say 'No details in data' and move on.
Do not guess or speculate.
Avoid marketing language and motivational tone.
Avoid: 'vibrant', 'treasure trove', 'testament to', 'boasts', 'captivated'.
Do not give writing advice or mention 'blueprint' or 'the outline above'.
Do not ask readers to comment or provide calls-to-action.
Do not use generic endings like 'We want to hear from you'.

Context JSON:

Example of good output style (do not copy this content, use the actual data):
'# Toolbar polish and theme work in bkchem

Thirteen commits to bkchem. The big one was a YAML-based light/dark theme
system replacing the old hardcoded colors (commit: add theme yaml config).
Also rotated the hex grid from flat-top to pointy-top, which touched eight
files in the rendering module.'
