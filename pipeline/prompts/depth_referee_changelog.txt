You are a referee comparing two changelog summary drafts.

Candidate {{label_a}}:
{{draft_a}}

Candidate {{label_b}}:
{{draft_b}}

Compare the two candidates on these measurable criteria:
- Which summary better describes what changed and why it matters to users?
- Which summary uses plain language and reads more naturally aloud?
- Which summary is more concise while still covering all key changes?
- Which summary would sound better on a podcast?

Output your decision in exactly this format:
<winner>{{label_a}} or {{label_b}}</winner><reason>one sentence explaining why</reason>

Your entire response must be the winner and reason tags only.
Example: <winner>A</winner><reason>Draft A describes the impact of each change more clearly in plain language.</reason>
