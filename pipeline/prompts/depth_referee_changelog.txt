You are a referee comparing two changelog summary drafts.

Candidate {{label_a}}:
{{draft_a}}

Candidate {{label_b}}:
{{draft_b}}

Compare the two candidates on these measurable criteria:
- Which summary retains more concrete details (file names, function names, PR numbers, commit subjects)?
- Which summary has less filler and fewer vague statements?
- Which summary is more concise while still covering all key changes?

Output your decision in exactly this format:
<winner>{{label_a}} or {{label_b}}</winner><reason>one sentence explaining why</reason>

Do not add any other text. Your entire response must be the winner and reason tags.
Example: <winner>A</winner><reason>Draft A preserves more file names and commit details while staying concise.</reason>
